TinyTinyBlog
============

This is just a small blog/pictures CMS i wrote two years ago, maybe somebody can found any use of it...

It was in french, but i've translated it in english.

You only have to edit the config.php and the tpl/about.php to get it working. but i didn't really tested it since (i'm working on others projects now).

Please note that it was really never made to be released like that, and even the source code should be readable and stable (the final blog worked!), i can't guarantee it's bug-free. feel free to fork it or fill a bug report if you find any.
