TinyTinyCart
============

A small e-commerce CMS i wrote two years ago in a rush for a friend, it doesn't have an admin panel, so it's really a frozen WIP here.

Maybe you can use it as a base for a complete CMS, who knows?

The code seems somewhat readable, even it's made in a code rush

It is not based on biscuit! even it looks like so, it's a pre-biscuit project, so take care :)
