Just source it from your zshrc

# Features
* Powerline-style prompt
* Displays the hostname and the path by default
* Display icons if the last command returned an error, if there's a background task running or if you're root
* When you are into a git repo, a second line will be displayed, showing the git status, divided in 3 parts: local, commit, remote
* * Local shows icons when you have modified files, added files, staged changes etc
* * Commit shows how many commit are you ahead/behind
* * Remote shows the branche and the remote, or the hash if you're detached
