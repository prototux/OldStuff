# Very simple session manager for uzbl-browser.
# To use, add a line like 'bind quit = spawn @scripts_dir/session.sh' to your
# config. This binding will exit every instance of uzbl and store the URLs they
# had open in $UZBL_SESSION_FILE.
#
# When a session file exists this script can be run with no arguments (or the
# argument "launch") to start an instance of uzbl-browser for every stored url.
#
# If no session file exists (or if called with "endsession" as the first
# argument), this script looks for instances of uzbl that have fifos in
# $UZBL_FIFO_DIR and instructs each of them to store its current url in
# $UZBL_SESSION_FILE and terminate.
#
# "endinstance" is used internally and doesn't need to be called manually.
