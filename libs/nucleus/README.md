Nucleus Game Engine, a (little) 3D game engine in C++ and OpenGL to learn about 3D engines.

Note: the sound files aren't here because i used my (local & legal) left4dead2 sounds to test (first think i had under my hand to test...).
The 3d files and their textures are from the raydium project (which i "came from" for the 3d things...).

Where am i: i did the basic thing, opening a window and displaying some 3d meshes, i can load as many meshs i want but can't move/rotate them, i cannot support multitexturing now (a mesh can have some textures, but not on the same triangle). sounds like i can load a music and sound, sounds are loaded and played, music aren't (they are loaded and played in the same function).
