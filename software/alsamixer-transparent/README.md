# alsamixer-transparent
Quick-and-Dirty patch for alsamixer to have transparent background and some custom colors...

# Warning
You need to merge this with alsa-utils (V1.0.29 when i did this)!

# Whatelse
Someday somebody may do a proper version with a configuration file... maybe a future me, probably not.
