SBBF is yet-another-brainfuck-interpreter, for the fun... and science, you monster.

What can i say? i was just bored some late evening and wanted to do that, to entertain me... i was disapointed, a BF interpreter dev time is about 30 minutes, but, well, it works.

NOTE: there's no protection against overflow of loop_mark... i'm too lazy to make it

* Compilling: make && sudo make install, you just need gcc and a libc.
* Usage: sbbf <file.bf> or as a script with #!/usr/local/bin/sbbf
* Licence: WTFPL _IS_ the ultimate licence for a brainfuck interpreter, isn't it?
