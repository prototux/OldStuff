# Remus
Some CLI ROM manager using Lua

# Purpose
This is just some ROM manager for linux, it's not fancy, doesn't have a GUI, it's just a basic system  now, because i have way too much ROMs and i didn't found any proper ROM manager using .dat files for this platform yet...

# Installation
Remus require luaFileSystem, on debian/ubuntu, it's lua-filesystem.

# Status
This is just some WIP now, you can check the commit log and the issues to see the progress on this

# Machines supported
There will be a machines.dat with a list of machines that Remus support, right now i'm testing it with the Atari 5200, because it's one with the fewest number of ROMs, but i plan to support at least the most common consoles.

# Datfiles supported
Right now, i try to make this usuable with No-Intro, TOSEC and GoodSets, i'll probably make a repo with the dat files i used...

# Remus?
Because naming it ROMulus was too mainstream.
